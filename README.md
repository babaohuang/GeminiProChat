## Running Locally

### Pre environment
1. **Node**: Check that both your development environment and deployment environment are using `Node v18` or later. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple `node` versions locally.

   ```bash
    node -v
   ```

2. **PNPM**: We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to manage dependencies. If you have never installed pnpm, you can install it with the following command:

   ```bash
    npm i -g pnpm
   ```

3. **GEMINI_API_KEY**: Before running this application, you need to obtain the API key from Google. You can register the API key at [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
    pnpm install
   ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file, then rename it to `.env`, and add your [`GEMINI_API_KEY`](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to the `.env` file.

   ```bash
    GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
   ```

3. Run the application, the local project runs on `http://localhost:3000/`.

   ```bash
    pnpm run dev
   ```
